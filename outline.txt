on the format, caveat (only take what fits), do exercises with your real materials, that's more important than following my examples!

based on book by professor, used in class for many years, book has 17 pages of references to scientific books and papers. plus my own experience, plus my own reading on happiness and success.

motivation: successful people

motivation: "I am a good decision taker."

motivation: for big and for small decisions, practise every day so you can execute perfectly when it really matters a lot.

?poll: write down three small decisions which you already took today

motivation: failure modes

general principle I: the process and the method are the multi-solution for many problems and failure modes. Process and method will appear and reappear often. Some other techniques will help against some specific challenges. 

general principle II: bring logic and intuition in agreement. make explicit what drives your intuition, rate the inputs of the rational process with your personal values and accept the outcome only if your intuition agrees. There is no heart-mind-dichotomy!

activating the process and actually take decisions
 + time boxes, deadlines
 + lightweight processes
 == find a small procrastinated decision and work on it right here:
     - either do pros/cons and decide (and do the first implementation step right after this workshop)
     - list concrete research actions (also decide which information you don't need) and commit when you want to do them
     
pro/con lists

============= this is the 50% mark â€“ getting from the pipeline of decisions to the deeper level ==========

?poll: write down one rather large decision which is coming up in your life on the mid-term planning horizon (this or next year, for example)
