on the format, caveat (only take what fits), do exercises with your real materials, that's more important than following my examples!

based on book by professor, used in class for many years, book has 17 pages of references to scientific books and papers.

motivation: successful people

motivation: "I am a good decision taker."

motivation: failure modes

general principle I: the process and the method are the multi-solution for many problems and failure modes. Process and method will appear and reappear often. Some other techniques will help against some specific challenges. 

general principle II: bring logic and intuition in agreement. make explicit what drives your intuition, rate the inputs of the rational process with your personal values and accept the outcome only if your intuition agrees. There is no heart-mind-dichotomy!

activating the process and actually take decisions
 + time boxes, deadlines

 == find a small procrastinated decision and work on it right here:

     - list concrete research actions (also decide which information you don't need) and commit when you want to do them
     
pro/con lists
 
alternatives
