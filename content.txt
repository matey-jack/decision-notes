Motivation 1: 
 - big brains are good for decisions, but not automatically so (see Kahnemann, Gilbert "stumbling")
 - every millisecond, at least one person in the world is taking a decision in hopes of becoming more happy or reaching a specific goal and probably he or she could do better. sometimes much better.
 - rationality is not just about numbers (money, time, material things, the measured self, ...), but it's also about finding the right balance between all the different aspects that play into a problem. in reality, we often have to compare apples and pears!
 
signs of successful and happy people:
 - have good relationships
 - know their own strengths and weaknesses realistically (and we'll talk about values later!)
 - know what they want and are good at taking decisions
==> good decisions contribute a lot to both your impact on the world and your personal happiness and fulfilment

motivational goal:  - creating the mindset: I am a good decision maker! I put the right amount of effort into every decision to maximize my outcome of happiness, [whatever goals], and overall life balance. I realize that taking decisions costs mental energy (and postponing them even makes it more costly) and I use that energy wisely.
Who in this rooms thinks they are quite good at making decisions?
Who thinks they are really good and significantly better than average?
Who thinks they are so good at decision making

failure modes in decisions:
 - not taking a decision (procrastinate deciding)
 - taking a decision, but not implementing it (procrastinate action)
 - you take a decision, implement it, and later regret it, that is, you come to believe that the decision was wrong – that is sad, but actually a great learning opportunity! (also, when judging your past decisions, focus on the process, not on the result – because many things you couldn't have know.)
 
(regret is less of a problem than our fear of regret and our uncertainty or doubts – by using good techniques we can tell ourselves "I did my best" and thereby beat the fear and doubts)


process:

=> get out of the "should I this or should I that" mode.
replace with:
 - by when will I decide?
 - what are my criteria?
 - how much time and effort will I put in this decision?
 - can I do a time box right now? can I schedule a time box right now?
 - what do I need (to research or prepare) for deciding?
 - keep a to-do list of the research work if it's more than one thing.
 

typical small decision for me:
coming home late at night: should I eat something or go straight to bed? if yes, what should I eat?
hidden value (need) behind this is actually "relaxing": eating before sleeping relaxes me enough to fall asleep easily. once I know that, I can find other ways to relax.

pro/con lists:
 - it's not more complicated than what you already know
 - some things you can do to make it better:
   - visualize the alternative in detail to find more things to consider
   - use info about one alternative to generate questions about the other alternative
   - name the criteria to find more criteria and more questions to answer about the alternatives
   - find out why you like or dislike certain alternatives
   - weight / rate importance of criteria
 - everything you do here, helps to make criteria and alternatives more explicit
 
  
values:

"Being clear about one’s values can make a big difference in life, as indicated by a
study of Harvard alumni (McGarvey, 1989). Those respondents who had explicit life
objectives were earning three times as much as those with no objectives, and those who'd
written their objectives down were earning three times as much again."

why values:
 - be really comprehensive: discover all criteria, cover all aspects, also the ones that are harder to measure, even the ones which are harder to put in words
 - values help us put criteria in context and come to a more meaningful prioritization: from salience to importance.
 - make explicit what until now only our intuition knows. (sometimes even things that we do not want to admit. but it is usually better to put all the values and criteria on the table even if are unsure if something should influence our decision or not.)
 - redundancy in the criteria helps to be really comprehensive, redundancy is not bad if we have enough structure to compensate for it
 - by making our values explicit we can prepare for future decisions without falling into a "always the same" trap. 
 
creativity: force-fit
(maybe list some more for inspiration)

alternatives:
 - the obvious alternatives are rarely the final ones
 - alternatives will become more concrete and tangible. often you can take sub-decisions which simplify visualizations and make the main decision clearer and easier to take
 - consider one value at a time and fulfil it perfectly. (do this even with the non-prio-one values) then force-fit other values from there
 - take all the best attributes of current alternatives and try to make something new of them
 - start from your resources
 
rephrasing: should I go abroad or stay here? to: if I go abroad, where should I go? and: if I stay here, how to make my life wonderful? (that is, satisfy all my values)  same if I go abroad: how to do it satisfying all my values?
