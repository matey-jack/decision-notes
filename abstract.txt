Based on a University Course on Rational Decision Making[1], we'll review the three essential steps of a rational decision (focus on process, use creativity, find balance) and do some exercises. We'll learn what makes good decision criteria and why it is helpful to base them on higher personal values. Aim of the workshop is to install some small reflexes (habits) that we can automatically activate when a decision comes our way. Practice with small decisions to prepare taking bigger ones. The biggest take-away is that most decisions are not A-or-B, but that a good decision process can help us to explore and plan the chosen alternative in a way that fulfils our needs better â€“ or even to resolve apparent contradictions be finding a better third alternative.
In the last third we'll apply a rational decision process to the selection of short- and mid-term goals. We look at the distinction between personal strengths and needs and use creativity to generate ideas for goals which are both meaningful and realistic.
